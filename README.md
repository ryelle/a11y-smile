## Project: SMILE

SMILE is a website that, once authorized, pulls in your upcoming events from Facebook, Meetup.com, Eventbrite (coming soon) and others ([make an issue to request specific services](https://github.com/ryelle/a11y-smile/issues)).

Once your events are imported, you can investigate the venue using Google Street View. Coming soon there will be an indicator for how accessible the space is. If the event is within the next 3 days, you can also check the weather for that day.

Check it out at [http://ryelle.github.io/a11y-smile/](http://ryelle.github.io/a11y-smile/).

## Possible Roadmap

- Integrate with Yelp to pull out the "Wheelchair Accessible" value for a venue
- Add some way of leaving "accessibility reviews" that can also tag what accomadations a venue provides/what the experience is like (maybe there are no steps, but is there enough space inside for a scooter? if there is food, what dietary restrictions can they handle? is there a lot of background noise that might make it hard to focus on conversations? etc) *or* integrate into a service that does this, and allow people to send reviews ([open an issue if you know of a site that already does this, I can work with them on an API](https://github.com/ryelle/a11y-smile/issues))
