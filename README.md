## Project: SMILE

SMILE is a website that, once authorized, pulls in your upcoming events from Facebook, Meetup.com, Eventbrite (coming soon) and others ([make an issue to request specific services](https://github.com/ryelle/a11y-smile/issues)).

Once your events are imported, you can investigate the venue using Google Street View. Coming soon there will be an indicator for how accessible the space is. If the event is within the next 3 days, you can also check the weather for that day.

Check it out at [http://ryelle.github.io/a11y-smile/](http://ryelle.github.io/a11y-smile/).
